      Welcome to Travel with Ronghe! I'm Ronghe - developer, designer, traveler, and storyteller. I love being able to wear so many hats, and I built this website to share my love for exploring new cities, capturing moments through a lens, and tasting food that tells a story. 

      What I enjoy about travel is the diversity of experiences - from famous landmarks to quiet side streets. Here you’ll find snapshots of the places that have inspired me, from bustling markets to hidden cafés.

      Just like in UX, travel teaches me to notice details, empathize with people, and design better experiences.
