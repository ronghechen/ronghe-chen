Spent New Year's Eve in NYC and had the opportunity to visit a lot of tourist attractions. Since NYC is huge, I'll be focusing on Manhattan only in this post, which is where I was most of the time. So, without further ado, here are some things to do in Manhattan!

## Times Square

Times Square is a major commercial hub in the middle of Manhattan, full of billboards and flashing lights. Here, you can grab some street food or watch a Broadway show.

## Soho

As the fashion hub of NYC, Soho features European-style architecture and cute cafes.

## Central Park

Here, you have the opportunity to enjoy quietness and nature within the hustle and bustle of the big city.

## Wall Street

          <img src="/images/nyc/ws1.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/nyc/ws2.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>

Located in the Financial District, Wall Street is home to the New York Stock Exchange and, if you happen to visit around the holidays, an annual tree lighting.

## Statue of Liberty

Although I could not get a good picture, I went on a cruise that gave me a view of the Statue of Liberty herself.

## 9/11 Museum

Located in the World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum serves as a rememberance for one of the darkest times in our nation's history.

## The Met

  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="/images/nyc/met1.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 1">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/nyc/met2.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 2">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/nyc/met3.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 3">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/nyc/met4.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 3">
    </div>
  </div>
  <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
</div>

The Met is home to art from around the world, from medieval European armor to Chinese pottery to ancient Egyptian tombs.

## Empire State Building

Get a breathtaking view of the city from one of the tallest buildings in the world.

So yeah, these are some of the main attractions in Manhattan that I recommend, however there are some things that I would like to do but didn't have time for, like visiting the Museum of Modern Art and Madame Tussauds. I really enjoyed my time here in NYC, and it seems like a great place to move once I graduate.
