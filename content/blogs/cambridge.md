Last summer, I studied abroad at the Pembroke Cambridge Summer Programme. Cambridge is a nice city with lots to do, and here are some of my favorite spots!

#### Pho

What's better than a nice warm bowl of pho on a 60-degree English "summer" day?

#### Pizza Pilgrims

Portions here were a little big for one person, but still really good. Also - don't knock pasta on pizza until you try it!

#### Yori

## Tourist Attractions

#### Fitzwilliam Museum

Located close to my accommodation, I really enjoyed viewing sculptures, paintings, and ancient artifacts in this museum! On the first floor was mostly sculptures from ancient Greece and Rome and pottery from Western Europe to the Middle East to East Asia, as well as armor from medieval Europe. The second floor was mostly paintings - historical paintings. A lot of these paintings focused on social commentary of their era, many of which had to do with the role of women in society. A painting that stood out to me was of a woman reading in nature, which represented how women (at the time) were expected to be connected to nature, and men were more associated with human culture, politics, and society. It seems very interesting because, although (unfortunately) gender stereotyping still occurs over certain occupations, the stereotypes have changed over the years. As I walked through the gallery, I saw paintings from many different perspectives. Many art museums focus on European paintings, since a lot of famous painters are from European countries. However, I had the opportunity to see paintings from around the world, and it felt great to see my culture represented in these museums.

#### Cambridge Marketplace

<img src="/images/cbg/marketplace.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

Here, there are a lot of shops where you can get food, clothes, jewelry, books, and souvenirs! I highly recommend checking it out, since I got a pair of earrings and a necklace here that I really like, as well as some good Thai, Chinese, Greek, and Turkish street food.

#### Punting on the River Cam

<img src="/images/cbg/punting.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

This one costs money, unfortunately, but I was able to get a nice view of a lot of colleges at Cambridge, and learn about their histories on the punting tour.

#### The Corpus Clock

<img src="/images/cbg/clock.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

I often walk past this clock, and find it quite interesting that it's shaped like a grasshopper. Apparently the grasshopper is "eating up" time, which is clever.

So yeah, that's my list of recs in Cambridge. If you ever end up visiting, be sure to check some of these things out!
