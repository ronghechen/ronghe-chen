When studying abroad at Cambridge, I've had a couple of opportunities to visit London. Here are some things you MUST do there:

#### Big Ben (pictured above)

As one of the most iconic sights of London, the Big Ben is well worth a visit. You can also get a nice view of the river.

#### Tower of London

Learn all about this 1,000+ year old castle, the famous criminals that inhabited its prisons, and take a look at the Crown Jewels (which unfortunately I was not allowed to get a picture of)!

#### Watch a show on the West End

I went with some friends to watch Les Mis, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Truly breathtaking.

#### Tate Modern
