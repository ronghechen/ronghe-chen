When studying abroad at Cambridge, I've had a couple of opportunities to visit London. Here are some things you MUST do there:

#### Big Ben (pictured above)

As one of the most iconic sights of London, the Big Ben is well worth a visit. You can also get a nice view of the river.

#### Tower of London

   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/towerofldn.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/mosaic.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>

Learn all about this 1,000+ year old castle, the famous criminals that inhabited its prisons, and take a look at the Crown Jewels (which unfortunately I was not allowed to get a picture of)!

#### Watch a show on the West End

I went with some friends to watch Les Mis, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Truly breathtaking.

#### Tate Modern

<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/tate1.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/tate2.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>
<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/haackephotographs.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive">
            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="/images/london/tate3.mp4" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
    </div>
</div>

The exhibits here are so modern and ground-breaking, and it's also free!

#### National Gallery

<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/exterior.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/seat.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>

Went here twice, loved it both times. It's also free, highly recommend.

#### British Museum

<div id="carouselExample" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%; margin-left: 25%;">
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="/images/london/britishmuseum1.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 1">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/london/britishmuseum2.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 2">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/london/britishmuseum3.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 3">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="/images/london/britishmuseum4.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Project 3">
    </div>
  </div>
  <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
</div>

Also went here twice, and I still didn't get through the whole museum because it's HUGE. Wish I could go back.

#### Borough Market

<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/borough market.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/greenjuice.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>

So many good eats here, the other day a friend & I got green juice here!

#### Walk across Tower Bridge

<img src="/images/london/bridge.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

#### St. Paul's Cathedral

<img src="/images/london/IMG_0655_VSCO.jpeg" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

Although I didn't actually go in, I was still able to get a great view of the architecture from the outside.

#### Chinatown

Lots of good food here, and I was able to get in touch with my culture.

#### Get Drinks at the Alchemist

<img src="/images/london/alchemist.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">

The Alchemist is a magic/alchemy themed bar in Covent Garden. Went here with a friend, and I loved the presentation of the drinks. I ordered an espresso martini and a French dip sandwich.

#### Walk around Soho

<div class="container">
   <div class="row">
          <img src="/images/london/prada.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/purses.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
          <img src="/images/london/street.png" class="mx-auto d-block" style="max-width: 50%; margin-top: 5%; margin-bottom: 5%;">
    </div>
</div>

Although I didn't buy anything, I still had a great time walking around.

So, yeah. Here are all my recs for things to do in London, I wish I was able to do more, such as go on the London Eye, visit Notting Hill, and tour the Shakespeare Globe, but time is limited. Thanks for reading!
