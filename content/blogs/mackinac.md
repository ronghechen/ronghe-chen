Spend a day with me on this picturesque, car-free island!

Got there early in the morning via ferry and caught this view.

As soon as I arrived, I walked around downtown. I noticed that the streets had an old-timey, European feel in their architecture. There were no cars, and people got around mostly on bikes and horse-drawn carriages.

I hiked up the hill, and fell in love with Mackinac's natural beauty.

At the very top of the hill, I walked through the woods. I also saw the British Landing, and learned a lot about the history of the island (including its role in the War of 1812)

I also visited the Nature Center, and got a nice view of Arch Rock:

And of course, ate a lot of fudge! If you ever visit Mackinac, you HAVE to try the fudge!

Visiting this beautiful, historic island was truly one of the highlights of this road trip.
