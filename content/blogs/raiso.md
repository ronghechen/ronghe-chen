Last summer, I studied abroad at the Pembroke Cambridge Summer Programme. Cambridge is a nice city with lots to do, and here are some of my favorite spots!

## Food

the responsible use of ai student organization (raiso) is an organization dedicated to educating students about the societal impacts of artificial intelligence, hosting programs that promote the discussion of societal and ethical implications of technology. sometimes, raiso holds events and invites ai researchers and designers to talk about their work and their views on the future of ai, and raiso also hosts workshops where students can build ai/ml projects.

## Tourist Attractions

our current website is outdated, missing key features like a projects page, which is essential for providing students hands-on experience in ai programming. furthermore, we need to add an events page to better promote our events and increase attendance.
